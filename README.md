# Amazon-Text-Machine-Learning-Model-Prediction
Using 3 different Vectorization techniques and then apply the different models to check the score.

#Vectorization techniques
1-Feature Extraction From TfidfVectorizer
TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents

2-Feature Extraction From Bag of Words (CounterVectorizer)
It is one of the most used text vectorization techniques. A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document.

3-Feature Extraction From Bag of n-grams
A bag-of-n -grams model represents a text document as an unordered collection of its n-grams.

#Model Building
1-Logistic Regression
2-Navie Bayes
3-Random Forest
